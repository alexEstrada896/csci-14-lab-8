1. (5 pts) Write a complete program in C++ that prompts the user to enter two different numbers (you can assume that the user will always enter two different numbers). The program should then determine and tell the user which number is the smaller and which is the larger.

A sample output:

99 is the smaller number, 100 is the bigger number.


2. (5 pts) Write a complete program in C++ that works as a guessing game.

Your program will ask the player to guess the number of a dice roll. After receiving the player's guess, the program will roll the dice (1 to 6 inclusive) using the random number functions. The program should compare the random dice roll number with what the player guessed, and display an appropriate message.

If the player's guess was CORRECT, your program should display a message similar to (assuming 6 was the number rolled)

Congratulations! Your guess of 6 was correct!
If the player's guess was INCORRECT, your program should display a message similar to (assuming 1 was the number rolled)

Sorry. Your guess of 6 was incorrect. You rolled a 1. Better luck next time!
